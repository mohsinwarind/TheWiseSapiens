                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The Wise Sapiens is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering enlightenment through dialogue,
                    writing, and visual expression in a society which is being radicalized for decades. We aim to cover
                    a broad spectrum of domains, starting from the facts of science to the mysteries of literature, to the
                    tapestry of history, and extending to the beauty of art, as they all collectively contribute to a
                    more rational and peaceful society we envisioned for.</p>
                <p>We strive to unfold the complexities of the universe about which <b>Stephen Hawking</b> told us and
                    shed light on the clandestine aspects of mother nature as described by <b>Carl Sagan</b> that govern
                    our life and give purpose to our existence. You can be a part of this revolution, and we hope that
                    through dedication, rigorous research, critical analysis, creative exploration, thoughtful analysis,
                    artistic expression, literary analysis, and reflective study, we can make this society a heaven as
                    promised by God, where pupils learn how to think, not what to think.</p>
